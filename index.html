                <p>
                    I love books! It may sound strange, but I really do. Ever since I was a little girl I've read a lot of books.
                    My mother even used to ask me questions about the book I was reading, because she thought I read
                    too fast to understand anything. But I could always retell the story. I really love to drift away into the
                    fantasyworld of a book. This is what I think is the best about reading but there are other advantages
                    about reading., let me describe a few.
                    To begin with it's very relaxing. You can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world
                    around you for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a
                    break, make a cup of tea and cuddle up in the corner of the sofa with a good book. After just a little
                    while of reading I've got my strength up to take care of everything. It's also a great way to calm down
                    before going to bed.
                    Secondly you can bring a book with you almost everywhere. It doesn't matter if youâ€™re on the subway,
                    on the bus, on the beach or on a journey. There's always room for a book in the bag.
                    Another good thing is that the way to school feels so much shorter if you have a book to read on the
                    subway. Furthermore there are so many different kinds of books. You can vary between reading novels with a lot of love or more educational books. Personally I think you can learn something in every book. It's really funny to try to identify with the characters of the book and to imagine the environment. I think reading develops the brain and gives you the ability to understand other people. Besides, you develop your language if you read a lot because you learn new words all the time. To sum things up you can say that the best way to learn things, or to develop your language is to read. And though it's educating it's also very relaxing and entertaining. Imagine a hot summerday on the beach with a cold lemonade and a good book. Personally I can't think of anything better!
